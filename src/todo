this is how you handle differentation...

quiz should ask last 10 standards
test should ask last 20
exam should ask last 30
...need better way to handle someone like minh tai who has some 5th buy may be at 4th or miguel. maybe a better way is go to where first unmastered is then ask backwards from there...

of start from beggining then ask everytime till they get it right...every type...
that would be 1000 questions right now. 10 questions a week at 37 weeks would be 370 not enuf. how bout 30 questions. that would be over 1110 but still not enuf for as i am about to add many. unless tests are taken at home. since we wont help anyway....that wouild be homework! and tests and it would all be naturally remeditation so no new stuff. they could also put zero and keep going. 

---------------------------------------
normal should only ask remediate if there is a remediate...it should not ask any gradelevel questions.....until remediate is good. 
-------------------------------------
no buffer instead make use mastery to take out some questions. 
---
5 item buffer in case kid is stuck. also show total above buffer..and total stuck in general...
-----------------
Basically we work on a set a starting level concept.
you set a starting level for the student then it will continue to ask the student mastered questions beginning at starting level
we could also have seperate settings. A mastered setting which is 10. Then a move on to next standard setting which is 5. Then a moveontonexttypesetting setting which is 3.

-----------------------------

just make application_math and application_ela then you don't have to include every darn file. then you can set subject session and javascript var.
-----------
we have an evaluation game class which is a test of all non-mastered items.
what if we have a remediate class that allows practice of 10 non-mastered items.....so you are never actually remediating thru the standards...  
just make sure you always set the level of remediate and evaluation to 1.
remediate will work similiar to evaluation but it will run thru 10 levels of things you got wrong.
what if we give you 10 then you leave. well in theory you would go right back to remediate anyway... as you would not have completed it. it would then simply
query the db again for 10 questions. which technically could change if you have mastered any in the earlier levels. 

so remediate will always be the 10 questions that you have not mastered. when you finish remediatiation you would goto next evaluation.  
if you fail evaluation you go to remediate
