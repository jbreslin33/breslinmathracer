add 5.g and 5.md

bugs
5.oa.a.1_25 order of operations makes problem wrong
6.ns.b.3_5 bug not sure what it is check it out.
5.nbt.a.4_1 user should not need to write g after answer for grams

----------------------

set score check from = to >=
also get rid of distinct date
select sub.first_name, sub.last_name, sub.description, sub.case FROM ( select users.first_name, users.last_name, evaluations.description, case when count(*) = evaluations.score_needed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END from evaluations_attempts join users on evaluations_attempts.user_id=users.id JOIN item_attempts ON item_attempts.evaluations_attempts_id=evaluations_attempts.id JOIN evaluations ON evaluations.id=evaluations_attempts.evaluations_id where evaluations_attempts.start_time > '2016-09-10 09:28:27.777635' AND evaluations_attempts.evaluations_id != 1 AND users.room_id = 2 AND item_attempts.transaction_code = 1 group by evaluations_attempts, evaluations.description, users.first_name, users.last_name, evaluations.score_needed) sub WHERE sub.case = 1;

store in 1 field....

where to store whether complete...
the advantage of 1 field is it's easily changeable and can stay if new evaluation is drawn up. 

so when do you fill it????? after an eval......and that is it???? otherwhise it might get overwritten

---
you need more fields in evaluations so it knows how many questions it should have had??
--------
start at grade beginning but if you pass milestones you can move to next grade???? competency?????

also I may ask you below grade level questions.....which will allow to delve into standard you don't know....

cons:
some stuff may be missed

pros:
--challanges students and what is missed can be offset by what is gained.
--need not worry as much about review and how long it takes to advance....

nessesary for it to work:
milestones must be difficult to pass and encompass the skills needed for next grade....

issue with tracking milestone....
how do you change milestones without losing kids who passed...

possible solution to above problem...
milestones are what will be used to determine question asked level....
this way if you change it students must retake milestone??????
this would help in automation as you won't have to up students level which may help especially at beggining of year and beginning of this system in general.

could you be finer in your setting of starting levels???
This would allow mean maybe chunking the milestones as well.

for third I can think of tables 3.oa.c.7 and also perimeter of rectangle and area of rectangle. This would make hopefully some tests smaller.
 
we can begin by allowing luke to test out....


to implement:
need a mechanism to set to a certain standard......just a field in db?????? grab it and then find matcing id on client then use that number as cutoff off client?

what it means...
you need to prob have many milestones in say nbt for certain grades.....
lets tackle decimal division...5.nbt.b.7 you pass it with 10 correct in a row.
or 4 seperate milestones for just that with 6 questions on each milestone. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
start at 6.2301 for 6.ee

query for homework:

select item_attempts.transaction_code from item_attempts JOIN evaluations_attempts ON evaluations_attempts.id=item_attempts.evaluations_attempts_id JOIN users ON evaluations_attempts.user_id=users.id where item_attempts.start_time > '2015-09-08 15:00:00' AND username = 'v1908';



select evaluations_attempts.id, item_attempts.transaction_code from item_attempts join evaluations_attempts on item_attempts.evaluations_attempts_id=evaluations_attempts.id where evaluations_attempts.evaluations_id = 7 AND evaluations_attempts.user_id = 5 order by item_attempts.start_time;

-------------------------------------------------

this is how you handle differentation...

quiz should ask last 10 standards
test should ask last 20
exam should ask last 30
...need better way to handle someone like minh tai who has some 5th buy may be at 4th or miguel. maybe a better way is go to where first unmastered is then ask backwards from there...

of start from beggining then ask everytime till they get it right...every type...
that would be 1000 questions right now. 10 questions a week at 37 weeks would be 370 not enuf. how bout 30 questions. that would be over 1110 but still not enuf for as i am about to add many. unless tests are taken at home. since we wont help anyway....that wouild be homework! and tests and it would all be naturally remeditation so no new stuff. they could also put zero and keep going. 

---------------------------------------
normal should only ask remediate if there is a remediate...it should not ask any gradelevel questions.....until remediate is good. 
-------------------------------------
no buffer instead make use mastery to take out some questions. 
---
5 item buffer in case kid is stuck. also show total above buffer..and total stuck in general...
-----------------
Basically we work on a set a starting level concept.
you set a starting level for the student then it will continue to ask the student mastered questions beginning at starting level
we could also have seperate settings. A mastered setting which is 10. Then a move on to next standard setting which is 5. Then a moveontonexttypesetting setting which is 3.

-----------------------------

just make application_math and application_ela then you don't have to include every darn file. then you can set subject session and javascript var.
-----------
we have an evaluation game class which is a test of all non-mastered items.
what if we have a remediate class that allows practice of 10 non-mastered items.....so you are never actually remediating thru the standards...  
just make sure you always set the level of remediate and evaluation to 1.
remediate will work similiar to evaluation but it will run thru 10 levels of things you got wrong.
what if we give you 10 then you leave. well in theory you would go right back to remediate anyway... as you would not have completed it. it would then simply
query the db again for 10 questions. which technically could change if you have mastered any in the earlier levels. 

so remediate will always be the 10 questions that you have not mastered. when you finish remediatiation you would goto next evaluation.  
if you fail evaluation you go to remediate
