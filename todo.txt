addition should be 1 question 0 + 0 for first level.
then 2 questions 0 + 0 and 0 + 1    for 2nd level
etc... order should be random.....half the questions should come from current level....other half from below...
if wrong go back to that level??? or just a level???? what if we used 10 correct?? let's ask away.
then when you get 10 correct at that level you advance....so if you are at 5 + 6 we ask you that half the time until you get 10 in a row on that game. then we advance you. NO GAMES IF YOU ALREADY HAD A LEVEL_TRANSACTION AT THAT LEVEL>>>>
