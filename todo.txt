addition should be 1 question 0 + 0 for first level.
then 2 questions 0 + 0 and 0 + 1    for 2nd level
etc... order should be random.....half the questions should come from current level....other half from below...
if wrong go back to that level??? or just a level???? what if we used 10 correct?? let's ask away.
then when you get 10 correct at that level you advance....so if you are at 5 + 6 we ask you that half the time until you get 10 in a row on that game. then we advance you. NO GAMES IF YOU ALREADY HAD A LEVEL_TRANSACTION AT THAT LEVEL>>>>

as soon as you get one wrong we need to know what level question that was and send you to that level???
then that is your new level but you can be asked anything up to your max level....


bascially they should all work like this. we should once in a while check old level then send you back for remediation...


ok new idea.
